# SOS_game
I am pleased to share that I have successfully developed a SOS game in Java using the Minimax algorithm. The game allows players to compete against each other by placing S and O symbols on a 3x3 grid, aiming to form the word 'SOS' horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  The implementation of the Minimax algorithm ensures that the game is played at an optimal level, where the computer player makes moves based on the best possible outcome, taking into account the opponent's potential moves.  The game's user interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with clear instructions for playing and interactive features that enhance the user experience.  Overall, the SOS game demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to apply advanced algorithms to create engaging and challenging games.
